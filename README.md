# Information
This is a MySQL API implemented in Rust together with Diesel.

*"Diesel is a database ORM for Rust that abstracts away the details of SQL and allows you to interact with databases in a generic and abstracted way. It integrates beautifully with Rocket, serde, and the rest of our software stack."*

- The program connects to the user 'guest' on the network 'localhost', with the password 'P@sSw0r_D' to the database 'pillow_db'.
- The purpose of this program is to allow for easier access to my local database for the project in Database Technique at Kristianstad University.
