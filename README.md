# Information
This is a simple terminal application written in the programming language Rust, together with a dependency called Diesel, which was used when creating the ORM.

*"Diesel is a database ORM for Rust that abstracts away the details of SQL and allows you to interact with databases in a generic and abstracted way."*

- The program connects to the user 'guest' on the network 'localhost', with the password 'P@sSw0r_D' to the database 'pillow_db'.
- The purpose of this application is to allow access to my local database for the project in the course Database Technique at Kristianstad University.
